This file lists major changes affecting abook's behavior.
Please read this file carefully when upgrading abook.
A more comprehensive list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog file.

--
Git:
 * New options: --email-fields. Allows --add-email to collect email
   addresses from other fields than From (eg: cc, bcc, or any other).
 * Improvement: custom fields export now fully supported by the "allcsv"
   and "custom" filters. It was previsouly unsupportted by "custom"
   and buggy for "allcsv" (restricted to fields named "custom[135]")
 * New short-option alias: -f is bound to --datafile
 * When closing abook and no change happened, the database file is not rewritten anymore.
   --add-email now works as expected even if another interactive abook instance is running
   (as long as the later does not modify the database)

0.6.1 (2015-08-11):
  * support for mouse
  * scrolling now affects the viewport instead of the cursor
  * support for a colored UI
  * added "groups" as a default field
  * the UI now supports merging selected entries [key M]
    and removing duplicates [key U]
  * a "custom" output filter allows the specification of an output
    format using placeholders
  * search-next is now bound to "/" too
  * some output filters can now be used in the context
    of --mutt-query. This is the case of "vcard" and "custom"
    [ no --query option has been created and --mutt-query is fully
      backward compatible ]
  * ldif output filter has been fixed [output modified] in multiple
    ways, does not force output to latin1 anymore and supports input
    from stdin.
  * vcard input/output support:
    An original input filter implementation was provided soon
       after 0.6.0pre2.
    In 2012, an optional build-time option to link against libvformat
    was added for the very same task: parsing vcard.
    - It depends on the --enable-vformat ./configure switch
    - It's only used as an input filter, especially useful to
      deal with multi-valued fields and encoded characters.
  * when the UI requests a confirmation from the user before a
    destructive operation it does not treat unknown key as "yes" anymore.
  * allcsv output changes:
    - header line uses lowercase
    - "MOBILEPHONE" column name changed to "mobile" (consistent w.r.t. standard_fields)
    - defined custom fields as well are part of the output now

0.6.0pre2 (2010-07-22):
  * Added anniversary as a default field
  * Display dates according to current locale
  * The four following configuration options have been deprecated and will
    no longer be accepted by abook:
      * emailpos
      * extra_column
      * extra_alternative
      * extrapos

    They have been replaced with a single more flexible option:
    index_format.

    This option is a string defining the format of a line in the main list.
    It allows displaying of as many fields as desired, with optional
    width limit, as well as an arbitrary number of alternative fields.

0.6.0pre1 (2006-08-30):
  * The 'customfield' command has been obsoleted by a more flexible set
    of commands: 'field' and 'view'.

    Those two commands make it possible to define fields and organize
    them within tabs as you see fit.

    Not using these commands, the look and feel of previous releases
    will mostly be kept the same. Also see the related 'preserve_fields'
    configuration variable.
